 Ja, the console IM client
===========================

As you probably can see already, it isn't a very mature project.

If you want to play it, I suggest the following:

 * install urwid-1.0.2 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/urwid)
 * install SleekXMPP (as fresh as possible) (https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP/wiki)
 * try running it:

 $ PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m ja

You should get something like this:

>>> This is ja version 0.1-alpha1
>>> Copyright Â© 2012 Edward Toroshchin <ja-project@hades.name>

and an input line at the bottom.

But there's more! You can even connect to some XMPP server:

 * first load the plugin:

> /load ja.plugins.xmpp
>>> loaded plugin xmpp from ja.plugins.xmpp

 * and then connect:

> /xmpp.connect <your JID>
Password for <your JID>: <type your password here>
>>> xmpp: connected to JID <your JID>

 * after that, if someone decides to say you something, a window appears:

>>> created new window 0 for chat with <ja.people.Contact object at 0x7f25ec01f290>

 * you can switch to it with the following command:

> /window 0

And that's really it. Enjoy. If you want to hack on it, I'll piss my pants out of sheer happiness.
